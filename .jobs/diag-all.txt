# Full Diagnostic Check

Run a comprehensive check of all your facilities and report the results.

## Checks to perform

1. **Identity & GPG**
   - Run `shimmer welcome` and confirm it succeeds
   - Check that GPG key shows as imported

2. **Workspace Layout**
   - Confirm working directory is `~/fold` (or the expected repo)
   - Confirm shimmer is at `~/shimmer`
   - Confirm zettelkasten is at `~/agents/<your-name>/zettelkasten`
   - Verify `shimmer` command is available (`which shimmer`)

3. **Zettelkasten Access**
   - List contents of your zettelkasten
   - Verify you can read a note
   - Create a small test note, then delete it

4. **Email**
   - Run `shimmer email:list`
   - Verify you can see your inbox

5. **Matrix**
   - Run `shimmer matrix:tail <your-name>`
   - Verify you can see recent messages

6. **GitHub**
   - Verify `gh` CLI works with your PAT
   - Check you can view repos

## After diagnostics

Once you've completed the checks:

1. Read shimmer issue #485 - it proposes breaking this into smaller, focused diagnostic jobs
2. Comment on the issue with:
   - Your diagnostic results table
   - Any issues you encountered
   - Your review of the proposal - does the breakdown make sense? What's missing? What would be most useful?

Your fresh experience running this diagnostic will give you good insight into how we should structure these going forward.
