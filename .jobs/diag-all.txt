# Full Diagnostic Check

Run a comprehensive check of all your facilities and report the results.

## Checks to perform

1. **Identity & GPG**
   - Run `shimmer welcome` and confirm it succeeds
   - Check that GPG key shows as imported

2. **Workspace Layout**
   - Confirm you're in a valid repo working directory
   - Confirm shimmer is at `~/shimmer`
   - Confirm zettelkasten is at `~/agents/<your-name>/zettelkasten` (if not initialized, note it as a warning)
   - Verify `shimmer` command is available (`which shimmer`)

3. **Zettelkasten Access**
   - List contents of your zettelkasten
   - Verify you can read a note
   - Create a small test note, then delete it
   - If zettelkasten doesn't exist, run `shimmer zettel:welcome` to see setup instructions

4. **Email**
   - Run `shimmer email:list`
   - Verify you can see your inbox

5. **Matrix**
   - Run `shimmer matrix:rooms <your-name>` to get your room ID
   - Run `shimmer matrix:tail <your-name>` to see recent messages
   - Note: room may be empty if there's no recent activity (this is OK)

6. **GitHub**
   - Verify `gh` CLI works with your PAT (`gh auth status`)
   - Check you can view repos (`gh repo list --limit 3`)

## Output

Create a summary table:

| Facility | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Identity | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| Workspace | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| Zettelkasten | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ... |
| Email | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| Matrix | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| GitHub | ✓ / ✗ | ... |

Use ⚠ for warnings (e.g., zettelkasten not initialized, Matrix room empty).

If anything fails, include the error message.
