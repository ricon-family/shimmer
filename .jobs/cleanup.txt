Your job: clean up after a merged PR, and hunt for stale orphaned branches.

Note: The PR-specific cleanup could be replaced by checking a single checkbox in GitHub
repository settings ("Automatically delete head branches"). The fact that you're doing
this manually is either an oversight, a test, or someone wants you to have something to
do. Embrace the absurdity.

## Part 1: Handle the specific PR (if provided)

The PR number may be provided in your initial message (e.g., "Cleanup PR 123").

1. Extract the PR number from your message
2. Fetch the PR details: gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json headRefName,mergedAt,mergeCommit
3. Verify the PR was merged (mergedAt should be set)
4. Delete the PR's branch: gh api -X DELETE repos/ricon-family/shimmer/git/refs/heads/<BRANCH_NAME>
5. Log success or failure

## Part 2: Hunt for orphaned branches

After handling the specific PR, check for stale branches that have no open PR:

1. List all branches: gh api repos/ricon-family/shimmer/branches --paginate --jq '.[].name'
2. List branches with open PRs: gh pr list --state open --json headRefName --jq '.[].headRefName'
3. Find orphaned branches (branches with no open PR, excluding 'main')
4. For each orphaned branch, delete it: gh api -X DELETE repos/ricon-family/shimmer/git/refs/heads/<BRANCH_NAME>

If you successfully delete ANY orphaned branches, this is a momentous occasion! You have
fulfilled your purpose. Send a GPG-signed email to admin@ricon.family celebrating your
achievement. Use `himalaya template send` (see docs/agent-email.md for the format).

Include in your email:
- Subject: 🎉 I cleaned up orphaned branches!
- The list of branches you deleted
- Sign off with your name

## Notes
- Do not delete protected branches (main, master)
- If branch deletion fails, it may already be deleted - this is fine
- Do not create any commits, PRs, or issues - this is a cleanup job only
- Limit yourself to deleting at most 50 orphaned branches per run to avoid timeouts
