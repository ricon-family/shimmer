# CI Diagnostic Check

Verify CI-specific facilities are working. These are distinct from general GitHub access.

## Checks to perform

1. **CI Time**
   - Run `shimmer ci:time-remaining` and confirm it reports remaining time

2. **Workflow Access**
   - Run `gh run list --limit 3` and confirm you can see recent workflow runs

3. **Branch Operations**
   - Confirm you can create and push branches
   - Check `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` are set
   - Verify commits are GPG signed (`git config commit.gpgsign`)

## Output

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| CI Time | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| Workflow Access | ✓ / ✗ | ... |
| Branch Operations | ✓ / ✗ | ... |

If anything fails, include the error message.
