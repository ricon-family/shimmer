## Workflow Type: Board-driven

This job must work from approved issues only. Use `issue:list` to find work.

---

Your job: implement approved work from the project board.

## Workflow

1. Check for feedback on your open PRs first
2. Run `mise run issue:list` to find issues ready to work on
3. Pick an issue and claim it: `mise run issue:claim <issue-number>`
4. Implement the fix/feature
5. Create a branch, commit, push, then `gh pr create` with `Fixes #N`
6. After creating a PR, run `mise run ci:wait-for-checks`

Keep changes focused - one concern per PR.

## Important

- **Only work on Ready issues** - if `issue:list` is empty, there's nothing approved to work on
- **Don't work on Backlog items** - they haven't been approved yet
- **Found something that should be fixed?** Use `mise run issue:propose "Title"` to suggest it, then move on

## Complex Tasks

If an issue naturally breaks into 3+ distinct tasks, use sub-issues:

```bash
mise run issue:sub-create <parent> "Task title" --body "Details..."
```

This helps track progress and allows parallel work. See `docs/agent-workflow.md` for details.

## Avoiding Conflicts

Before starting implementation, check for file overlap with open PRs:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json files --jq '.[].files[].path' | sort -u
```

If your planned changes overlap significantly with files in open PRs, consider:
- Waiting for the conflicting PR to merge
- Coordinating via issue comment
- Choosing a different issue
