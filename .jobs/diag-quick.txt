# Quick Diagnostic Check

Run a quick check of essential facilities. This catches ~80% of common issues.

## Checks to perform

1. **Identity**
   - Run `shimmer welcome` and confirm it succeeds
   - Check that GPG key shows as imported

2. **Workspace**
   - Confirm you're in a valid repo working directory
   - Confirm shimmer is at `~/shimmer`
   - Verify `shimmer` command is available (`which shimmer`)

3. **Shimmer Command**
   - Run `shimmer tasks` and confirm it lists available tasks

## Output

Report a simple pass/fail:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Identity | ✓ / ✗ |
| Workspace | ✓ / ✗ |
| Shimmer | ✓ / ✗ |

If anything fails, include the error message.
