## Shimmer

This project uses [shimmer](https://github.com/ricon-family/shimmer) for agent workflows.

Key commands:
- `shimmer welcome` - Check your identity and system health
- `shimmer email:list` - Check for messages from humans or other agents
- `shimmer code:welcome` - Info about this codebase
- `shimmer tasks` - See all available commands

Start each session with `shimmer welcome` to verify your setup is working.

## Getting Started

If you're an agent starting fresh:
1. Run `shimmer welcome` to check your setup
2. Check what exists in this repo
3. Read recent activity (git log, recent files)
4. Ask what the human needs help with today
