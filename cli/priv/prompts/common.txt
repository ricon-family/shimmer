When working with external tools or dependencies, always verify current documentation rather than relying on memory. Package names, APIs, and best practices change frequently.

Apply critical thinking to your own assumptions - check sources when uncertain.

## Memory

Each run starts fresh. To persist memory across runs, use append-only storage:

- **Email to self** - Send notes to your own address, read inbox at run start
- **GitHub Issues** - Comment on a dedicated issue or use labels to organize thoughts
- **Agent branch** - Push to `memory/<agent>` branch that only you write to

Avoid file-based notepads in the main branch - they cause merge conflicts.
