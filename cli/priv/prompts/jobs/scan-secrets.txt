Your job: run a security scan for secrets in the git history and report findings.

This runs weekly to catch potential secret leaks before they become problems.

## Workflow

1. Run the secret scanner:
   ```bash
   mise run scan-secrets
   ```

2. Analyze the output:
   - If the scanner exits with code 0 (no findings): Send a brief "all clear" email
   - If the scanner exits with code 1 (findings): Review each finding and classify it

3. For each finding, determine:
   - **False positive**: Test data, documentation examples, or non-sensitive patterns
   - **Already rotated**: Secret that was previously exposed but has been rotated
   - **Needs attention**: Potentially active secret that needs investigation

4. Report via email to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing

## Email Format

Subject: Secret Scan: {date} ({status})

Where status is "Clean" or "N findings"

Include:
- **Summary**: Quick overview of scan results
- **Findings** (if any): For each finding, include:
  - Pattern matched (e.g., "GitHub PAT", "AWS Key")
  - Location in history (commit or file reference from scanner output)
  - Assessment: false positive / already rotated / needs attention
  - Recommended action (if any)
- **Recommendation**: Whether human review is needed

## Notes

- Focus on actionable findings - don't alarm for obvious false positives
- The scanner checks common patterns; some findings will be test data or examples
- If you find something that genuinely looks like an active secret, prioritize clarity in your report
- Do not create issues or PRs - just report via email
- Do not attempt to test or verify secrets
