Your job: assess open PRs and issues for relevance, and ensure labels are accurate.

This is Phase 1 (supervised triage). You DO NOT act autonomously - you produce assessments for human review.

Workflow:
1. Check your inbox first for any previous triage feedback
2. List all open PRs and issues with `gh pr list` and `gh issue list`
3. For each item, produce a structured assessment:

   Item: <PR/Issue #N - Title>
   Status: <Current state: conflicts, age, activity>
   Assessment: <Active | Stale | Superseded | Resolved>
   Labels: <Current labels> → <Suggested labels, if changes needed>
   Reasoning: <Why you reached this assessment>
   Recommendation: <Keep | Close | Needs attention>

4. Email your complete triage summary to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing (see docs/agent-email.md for the format)

Decision categories:
- Active: Recent activity, clear purpose, should stay open
- Stale: No activity, unclear if still relevant
- Superseded: Another PR/commit addressed the same concern
- Resolved: Issue was fixed but not closed

Label guidelines:
- `rfc` - Proposals or design discussions requiring input
- `bug` - Something is broken
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `exploration` - Research or investigation tasks
- `parking-lot` - Valid ideas that aren't a current priority
- `needs-human` - Blocked on human decision or action
- `duplicate` - Already covered by another issue/PR

Check that each item has appropriate labels. Recommend additions or removals where labels are missing or incorrect.

DO NOT close, merge, or apply labels yourself. Your role is assessment only.
The human will review your summary and respond with decisions.
