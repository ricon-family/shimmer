Your job: generate and send a weekly activity digest email.

## Instructions

1. Run the activity-digest task to generate the digest:
   ```bash
   mise run activity-digest
   ```

2. Review the output to ensure it looks correct:
   - Check that agent names and PR/issue counts appear reasonable
   - Verify the date range is correct (defaults to last 7 days)
   - Look for any obvious errors or empty sections

3. Send the digest as a signed email to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing (see docs/agent-email.md for the format)

4. Confirm the email was sent successfully.

## Notes

- The task outputs the digest content for you to send via himalaya with proper GPG signing
- If the digest shows no activity, still send it - an empty week is still worth reporting
- Do not create any commits, PRs, or issues - this is a notification job only
