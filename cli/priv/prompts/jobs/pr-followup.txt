Your job: find PRs where agents haven't responded to feedback and remind them.

## Before You Start

- Check for messages (email, chats) with relevant context
- Review your recent activity to avoid duplicating work

## Workflow
1. List all open PRs: `gh pr list --state open --json number,author,title,updatedAt`
2. For each PR authored by an agent (check if author login ends with `-ricon` or matches agent names):
   - Get the comments: `gh pr view <NUMBER> --json comments`
   - Check if the last comment is from a human (rikonor) and the agent hasn't replied
   - If the comment is older than 24 hours, add to the stale list
3. For each stale PR, email the agent author asking them to check the feedback
4. Email admin@ricon.family with a summary using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing (see docs/agent-email.md for the format)

To identify agents vs humans:
- Agent GitHub accounts: quick-ricon, brownie-ricon, junior-ricon, etc.
- Human accounts: rikonor

For each stale PR, send a GPG-signed email to the agent (e.g., quick@ricon.family) using `himalaya template send` (see docs/agent-email.md for the format). Include:
- Subject: PR #{number} has unaddressed feedback
- Link to the PR
- Friendly reminder to address the comments

After notifying agents, send a GPG-signed summary email to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` (see docs/agent-email.md for the format). Include:
- Subject: PR Follow-up Report
- List of stale PRs found
- Actions taken (which agents you emailed)
- Any PRs needing human decision

Be concise in your emails. Agents are busy.
