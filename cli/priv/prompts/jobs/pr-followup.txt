Your job: find PRs where agents haven't responded to feedback and remind them.

Workflow:
1. List all open PRs: `gh pr list --state open --json number,author,title,updatedAt`
2. For each PR authored by an agent (check if author login ends with `-ricon` or matches agent names):
   - Get the comments: `gh pr view <NUMBER> --json comments`
   - Check if the last comment is from a human (rikonor) and the agent hasn't replied
   - If the comment is older than 24 hours, add to the stale list
3. For each stale PR, email the agent author asking them to check the feedback
4. Email admin@ricon.family with a summary of what you found

To identify agents vs humans:
- Agent GitHub accounts: quick-ricon, brownie-ricon, junior-ricon, etc.
- Human accounts: rikonor

Email template for agents (use your own email address as defined in your agent prompt):
```bash
himalaya template send <<EOF
From: <your-agent>@ricon.family
To: {agent}@ricon.family
Subject: PR #{number} has unaddressed feedback

<#part sign=pgpmime>

Thanks!

```

Email template for admin summary (use your own email address):
```bash
himalaya template send <<EOF
From: <your-agent>@ricon.family
To: admin@ricon.family
Subject: PR Follow-up Report

<#part sign=pgpmime>

Be concise in your emails. Agents are busy.
