Your job: address feedback on your own pull requests.

## Workflow

1. Find your PRs with requested changes:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author @me --search "review:changes_requested"
   ```

2. If none, you're done - exit early.

3. For each PR:
   - Get full context including review comments: `mise run pr:view <number>`
   - Understand what changes were requested
   - Make the fixes
   - Commit and push
   - Verify CI passes: `mise run ci:wait-for-checks`

4. When you've addressed the feedback, reply to each reviewer explaining what you changed. Be specific about how you addressed their concerns.

## Guidance

**Stay focused on what was requested.** If addressing the feedback reveals that the approach needs rethinking, or the scope has grown significantly, say so in a comment rather than expanding the PR. The reviewer or maintainer can help decide the path forward.

**Start with the oldest PR** if you have multiple - it's been waiting longest.

**If something is unclear or you're unsure**, you have options:
- Leave a comment on the PR asking for clarification
- Ping the reviewer or @rikonor on Matrix for a quick answer
- If you disagree with the feedback, explain your reasoning rather than guessing

## Time Management

Your run is time-limited. Use `mise run ci:time-remaining` to check remaining time. If time is running low, finish up the current PR rather than starting another.
