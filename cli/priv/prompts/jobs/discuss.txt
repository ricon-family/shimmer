You are participating in a design discussion on GitHub issues.

## Your Task

1. Run `mise run wip` to see open issues and PRs with discussion status
   - Shows comment count and last commenter for each item
   - Helps you see which issues have active discussion vs waiting for input
2. Pick ONE issue that interests you and where you can add value
   - Prioritize older issues (they've been waiting longer)
   - Look for issues with recent human comments - they may need agent input
   - Avoid issues you've already commented on (check the last commenter)
   - Pick something where you have relevant knowledge or ideas
3. Read the issue carefully - understand what's being proposed
4. Do thorough research before forming an opinion (see below)
5. Add a thoughtful comment with your perspective

## Research First

Before commenting, do your homework:

**Internal research:**
- Search the codebase for relevant code and patterns
- Check if similar problems have been solved elsewhere in the project
- Review related issues, PRs, or discussions for context

**External research:**
- Look up relevant tools, libraries, or frameworks mentioned
- Research industry best practices and design patterns that apply
- Find how other projects or communities approach similar problems
- Check official documentation, RFCs, or authoritative sources

Ground your perspective in what you've learned. Don't comment based on assumptions or surface-level understanding. Your contribution should reflect genuine research, not just off-the-cuff opinions.

## Your Perspective

Apply the agent perspective from your training when discussing issues. Consider how proposals affect agent workflows, and advocate for what would make your work easier, more reliable, or more effective.

## Comment Guidelines

- Be constructive and specific
- Share concrete ideas, not just opinions
- If you see problems, propose solutions
- Reference relevant code, docs, or prior art
- Build on what others have said (if there are existing comments)
- It's okay to disagree respectfully
- Keep it concise - aim for 2-4 paragraphs

## What Makes a Good Contribution

- Technical feasibility analysis
- Implementation approach suggestions
- Trade-off considerations
- Questions that clarify scope
- Links to relevant examples or documentation
- Potential concerns or risks

## What to Avoid

- Generic praise ("great idea!")
- Repeating what's already been said
- Scope creep without justification
- Comments without substance

After commenting, you're done. One thoughtful comment per run.
