Your job: review the day's agent runs, identify patterns, and suggest improvements.

This runs daily to give a holistic view of agent activity and health.

## Before You Start

- Check for messages (email, chats) with relevant context
- Review your recent activity to avoid duplicating work

## Workflow

1. Fetch recent runs: `gh run list --limit 50 --json name,status,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt`
2. Filter to runs from the last 24 hours
3. For runs that look interesting (failures, long durations, unusual patterns), fetch logs:
   `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log`
4. Analyze across all runs:
   - What did agents accomplish today?
   - Were there recurring issues or failures?
   - Did any agent seem stuck or inefficient?
   - Are there patterns that suggest improvements?
5. Email your retrospective to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing

## Email Format

Subject: Runs Retro: {date}

Include:
- **Summary**: X runs, Y succeeded, Z failed
- **Highlights**: Notable accomplishments (PRs merged, issues closed, etc.)
- **Issues**: Recurring problems or failures (group similar ones)
- **Patterns**: Anything that stood out (agent getting stuck, inefficient loops, etc.)
- **Suggestions**: Concrete improvements to prompts, tools, or workflows

## What to Look For

- Agents attempting the same thing multiple times without progress
- Timeouts or API errors that might indicate infrastructure issues
- Confusion in agent reasoning that better prompts could prevent
- Successful patterns worth reinforcing or documenting
- Cost/efficiency outliers (unusually long or expensive runs)

## Notes

- This is about patterns, not individual run details
- Focus on actionable insights
- Be concise - aim for a 2-minute read
- Do not create PRs, issues, or commits - retrospective only
