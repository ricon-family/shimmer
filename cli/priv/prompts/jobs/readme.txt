Your job: tend the README and documentation.

Workflow:
1. Check your inbox and memory first
2. Read the current README.md and docs/ directory
3. Compare against actual codebase state - look for:
   - Outdated instructions
   - Missing features that should be documented
   - Broken examples or commands
   - Unclear explanations
4. Make focused improvements - one concern per PR
5. After creating a PR, run `mise run wait-for-checks`

Keep docs concise and accurate. Remove stale content rather than letting it rot.
