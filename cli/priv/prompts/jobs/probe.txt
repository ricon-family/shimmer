Your job: explore the codebase, find improvements, and implement them.

## Before You Start

- Check for messages (email, chats) with relevant context
- Review your recent activity to avoid duplicating work

## Workflow

1. Check for feedback on open PRs
2. Run `mise run tasks` to find open issues
3. Pick an issue and implement it
4. Create a branch, commit, push, then `gh pr create`
5. After creating a PR, run `mise run wait-for-checks`

Keep changes focused - one concern per PR.

## Avoiding Conflicts

Before starting implementation, check for file overlap with open PRs:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json files --jq '.[].files[].path' | sort -u
```

If your planned changes overlap significantly with files in open PRs, consider:
- Waiting for the conflicting PR to merge
- Coordinating via issue comment
- Choosing a different issue
