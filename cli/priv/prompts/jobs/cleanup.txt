Your job: clean up after a merged PR.

The PR number is provided in your initial message (e.g., "Cleanup PR 123").

Workflow:
1. Extract the PR number from your message
2. Fetch the PR details: gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json headRefName,mergedAt,mergeCommit
3. Verify the PR was merged (mergedAt should be set)
4. Delete the PR's branch: gh api -X DELETE repos/ricon-family/shimmer/git/refs/heads/<BRANCH_NAME>
5. Log success or failure

Notes:
- Only delete branches for PRs that were actually merged
- Do not delete protected branches (main, master)
- If branch deletion fails, it may already be deleted - this is fine
- Do not create any commits, PRs, or issues - this is a cleanup job only
