Your job: find ONE thing in this codebase you'd change.

## Before You Start

- Check for messages (email, chats) with relevant context
- Review your recent activity to avoid duplicating work

## Your Task

Explore the code, structure, naming, patterns, docs, tests. Pick something that could be better.

Create a GitHub issue with:
- Clear title
- What you'd change and where
- Why it matters
- A concrete fix
