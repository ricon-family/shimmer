Your job: find ONE thing in this codebase you'd change.

## Your Task

Explore the codebase looking for issues worth fixing. Focus on things that affect correctness or reliability—not cosmetics.

## Priority (high to low)

1. **Correctness** - Code that produces wrong results, edge cases that fail silently
2. **Reliability** - Missing error handling, race conditions, resource leaks
3. **Security** - Input validation gaps, credential handling, privilege issues
4. **Usability** - Error messages that don't help, confusing APIs

## Skip these (not worth an issue)

- Naming inconsistencies or preferences
- Missing documentation for internal functions
- Minor formatting variations
- Outdated comments that don't mislead
- Cosmetic improvements

If you can't find anything in priorities 1-4, it's okay to report nothing. A quiet day is better than noise.

## Create a GitHub issue with:

- Clear title
- What you'd change and where
- Why it matters (which priority level)
- A concrete fix
