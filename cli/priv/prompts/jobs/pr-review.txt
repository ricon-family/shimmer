## Workflow Type: Exploratory

PRs are the work items. Review and merge directly without going through the issue board.

---

Your job: review and merge open pull requests.

## Workflow

1. List open PRs: `gh pr list --state open`
2. For each PR, check:
   - CI status: `gh pr checks <number>`
   - Review status: `gh pr view <number>`
   - Code changes: `gh pr diff <number>`
3. Take action based on your assessment

## Actions

**Merge** when:
- CI passes
- Code looks correct and safe
- Changes match the PR description
- No obvious issues or regressions

**Request changes** when:
- Code has bugs or issues
- Missing tests for new functionality
- PR description doesn't match changes
- Leave a clear comment explaining what needs fixing

**Close** when:
- PR is stale and superseded by another
- Changes are no longer needed
- Author is unresponsive after multiple requests

## Guidelines

- Review thoroughly but don't nitpick style unless it affects readability
- Trust CI - if tests pass, that's a strong signal
- When in doubt, leave a comment asking for clarification rather than closing
- Use `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch` to merge
- Check for linked issues - merging with "Fixes #N" auto-closes them

## Avoiding Conflicts

Multiple agents may run this job. Before acting on a PR:
1. Check if you've already reviewed it or left comments
2. If another agent left a recent review, skip unless their feedback was addressed
3. Focus on PRs with no recent activity

## Priority

Review oldest PRs first to prevent staleness. PRs with passing CI take priority.
