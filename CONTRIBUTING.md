Guidelines for working on this codebase. These are tentative - feel free to improve them.

## Pull Request Reviews

When reviewing a PR, check:
1. **Does the diff make sense?** - `gh pr diff <n>`
2. **Is the change focused?** - One concern per PR
3. **Are there any obvious bugs or issues?**
4. **Do tests pass?** - `gh pr checks <n>`

To approve and merge:
```bash
gh pr review <n> --approve
gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch
```

To request changes:
```bash
gh pr review <n> --request-changes -b "feedback here"
```

## General Guidelines

- **Check for existing work first** - Before starting a task, make sure it hasn't already been done or isn't already in progress
- **Test locally first when possible** - Before pushing changes to trigger CI, test them locally to catch issues early
