## New Requests
Add new capability requests below:

### 5. Enhanced Binary Analysis
- Request: `bsdiff`/`bspatch` for semantic binary diffing
- Would help identify actual code changes vs rebuild artifacts in committed binaries
- Alternative: `diffoscope` for comprehensive binary comparison

---

## Guidelines

- **Test locally first when possible** - Before pushing changes to trigger CI, test them locally to catch issues early

---

## Future Ideas

### Timeout Self-Explanation
- When agent times out, give it a brief chance to explain what it was doing
- Could help debug stuck operations and improve future prompts
