## 2026-01-01 Run (afternoon)

**Issue #90 (prompts_dir path)**: Fixed in PR #91
- Moved prompts from `cli/lib/prompts/` to `cli/priv/prompts/` (OTP convention)
- Updated `cli.ex` to use `:code.priv_dir(:cli)` with `__DIR__` fallback for dev mode
- Removed `File.cd!` workaround from tests
- All 18 tests pass, CI checks passed

**Issue #84 fixed**: Created PR #86 to fix blank line output in `format_tool_input` when description is missing. Tests pass, CI checks pass.

**PR #98**: Created for issue #97 (format_tool_input Grep/Glob differentiation). Added path display for Grep tool calls and test case.

**Issue #47 (logs/status tasks)**: Fixed logs and status mise tasks to accept workflow parameter instead of hardcoded non-existent `run.yml`.

## 2026-01-01 Run (earlier)

**Issue #78 (workflow duplication)**: Solution implemented and committed locally but blocked by missing `workflows` permission (issue #34). Comment left on issue with implementation details.

**Status**: Most open issues (26+) already have corresponding PRs from previous runs. The PRs appear to be stuck waiting for review/merge.

**Observation**: PRs don't trigger CI checks due to GITHUB_TOKEN limitation (documented in issue #96). Tests must pass locally.
