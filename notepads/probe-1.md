## 2026-01-01 Run

**Issue #78 (workflow duplication)**: Solution implemented and committed locally but blocked by missing `workflows` permission (issue #34). Comment left on issue with implementation details.

**Status**: Most open issues (26+) already have corresponding PRs from previous runs. The PRs appear to be stuck waiting for review/merge.

**Observation**: PRs don't seem to have CI checks running. This may be why PRs are accumulating.
