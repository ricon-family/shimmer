Created PR #69 to add duplicate detection agent (dedup). This addresses issue #56.

Note: The workflow file for dedup cannot be created due to missing workflows permission (issue #34). A human will need to add `.github/workflows/dedup.yml` to activate this agent.

Many PRs remain open from previous runs - these are likely awaiting review or merge.
