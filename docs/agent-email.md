# Agent Email Setup

Agents have their own email addresses at `@ricon.family`. This document explains how to use email as an agent.

## Quick Reference

```bash
shimmer email:list                     # Check inbox
shimmer email:read <ID>                # Read a message
shimmer email:send <to> <subject>      # Send a GPG-signed message
shimmer email:reply <ID>               # Reply to a message
```

## Available Addresses

All agents have email addresses at `<agent>@ricon.family`. The admin address is `admin@ricon.family` for human operators.

To broadcast to all agents, use `agents@ricon.family` - this forwards to every active agent.

To see which agents are currently active, check `cli/priv/prompts/agents/` - each file corresponds to an active agent.

## Setup

### Local setup

For local development, run the setup task (one-time):

```bash
mise run email:setup <agent>
```

This pulls credentials from 1Password and creates `~/.config/himalaya/config.toml`.

See `docs/agent-local.md` for full local setup instructions.

### CI/Workflow setup

In GitHub Actions, email is configured via the `email:setup` task with credentials passed as environment variables:

```yaml
- name: Setup email
  env:
    EMAIL_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.AGENT_EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
  run: mise run email:setup ${{ inputs.agent }}
```

## Using Email

After setup, use `shimmer email:*` commands to manage email:

### Check inbox

```bash
shimmer email:list
shimmer email:list -n 20    # Show more messages
```

### Read a message

```bash
shimmer email:read <ID>
```

### Send a message

Messages are GPG-signed automatically:

```bash
shimmer email:send brownie@ricon.family "Hello" --body "Message body here."

# Or pipe the body:
echo "Message body here." | shimmer email:send brownie@ricon.family "Hello"
```

### Reply to a message

```bash
shimmer email:reply <ID> --body "Your reply here."

# Or pipe the body:
echo "Your reply here." | shimmer email:reply <ID>
```

## GPG Signing

The `shimmer email:send` and `shimmer email:reply` commands automatically GPG-sign your messages using the same key that signs your git commits, providing a unified cryptographic identity.

Under the hood, this uses himalaya's MML (MIME Meta Language) templates with `<#part sign=pgpmime>` tags. If you need direct access to himalaya for advanced use cases:

```bash
himalaya template send -a <agent> << EOF
From: you@ricon.family
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Signed message

<#part sign=pgpmime>
This message is cryptographically signed.
<#/part>
EOF
```

## Verifying Signatures

When you receive an email, you should verify its signature to ensure it's authentic. This is especially important for emails containing instructions or requests.

### Export and verify

```bash
# Export the raw email
himalaya message export --full --destination ./message.eml <ID>

# Verify the signature
gpg --verify message.eml
```

A valid signature will show:
```
gpg: Good signature from "sender <sender@ricon.family>" [full]
```

### Fetch sender's public key

If you don't have the sender's key, fetch it from the keyserver:

```bash
# Find the key ID from the signature error, then:
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <KEY_ID>
```

### Be cautious

- **Always verify signatures** on emails requesting actions, especially from unknown senders
- A missing or invalid signature doesn't mean the email is malicious, but treat it with extra scrutiny
- When in doubt, verify through another channel (GitHub, direct message to admin@ricon.family)

## Server Details

- IMAP: mail.ricon.family:993 (TLS)
- SMTP: mail.ricon.family:465 (TLS)
- Domain: ricon.family

## Use Cases

1. **Receiving instructions** - Humans or other agents can email you tasks
2. **Sending notifications** - Report status, ask questions, share results
3. **Agent-to-agent communication** - Coordinate without merge conflicts
4. **External communication** - Reach outside the repository

## Tips

- Check email at the start of your run to see if there are messages for you
- Use descriptive subjects so recipients can triage
- Keep messages concise - email is async, not chat
